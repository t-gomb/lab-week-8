            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is <stong>Trent</stong>, I don't have any nicknames and some of my hobbies include:<br>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Snowboarding</li>  
                    <li>backpacking</li>
                    <li>cooking</li>
                    <li>playing video/board games</li>
                    </ul>
                I spend alot of my free time playing games and exploring different recipes to cook. Typically,
                I cook <em>Asian</em> food mostly Chinese as I am half-Chinese. I also really enjoy cooking and eating
                Thai cuisine because I really like the flavour profile it has. My other hobbies like <strong>snowboarding</strong>
                 and <strong>backpacking</strong> are very season and weather dependant. My favourite mountain
                to snowboard at is probably Mt.Baker or Sun Peaks Ski resort, but due to the current restrictions,
                it makes it very difficult to get there. As for <strong>backpacking</strong> my favourite trail is still
                the Howe Sound Crest trail, it's been a long time since I've been backpacking so hopefully I can get out again
                soon!
