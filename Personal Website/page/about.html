        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is <stong>Trent</stong>, I don't have any nicknames and some of my hobbies include:<br>
                <ul>
                <li>Snowboarding</li>  
                <li>backpacking</li>
                <li>cooking</li>
                <li>playing video/board games</li>
                </ul>
            I spend alot of my free time playing games and exploring different recipes to cook. Typically,<br>
            I cook <em>Asian</em> food mostly Chinese as I am half-Chinese. I also really enjoy cooking and eating<br>
            Thai cuisine because I really like the flavour profile it has. My other hobbies like <strong>snowboarding</strong>
            <br> and <strong>backpacking</strong> are very season and weather dependant. My favourite mountain
            to snowboard at<br> is probably Mt.Baker or Sun Peaks Ski resort, but due to the current restrictions,
            it makes it very<br> difficult to get there. As for <strong>backpacking</strong> my favourite trail is still
            the Howe Sound Crest trail,<br> it's been a long time since I've been backpacking so hopefully I can get out again
            soon!<br>
